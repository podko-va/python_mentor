Are there specific rules for certain user agents?

Yes. The robots.txt file includes rules specific to different user agents. For example:

Rules for User-agent: * apply to all crawlers.

Rules for User-agent: GPTBot or User-agent: Applebot define what those specific bots are allowed or not allowed to access.


Why websites use robots.txt and how it promotes ethical scraping:

Websites use robots.txt files to define which parts of their site can or cannot be accessed by automated web crawlers. 
This helps protect server resources, reduce traffic overload, and safeguard sensitive or irrelevant content. 
Respecting robots.txt promotes ethical scraping by ensuring that scrapers do not harm the site's performance 
or violate its intended use policies.
